#  Mental Health Prediction System

This project is a basic machine learning web application that predicts whether a person may be experiencing a mental health issue based on survey data.

It uses a trained ML model on a dataset from Kaggle, and includes a simple web interface for users to submit input. The frontend is built using **React**, the backend uses **Flask**, and the ML model was built using libraries like **scikit-learn** and **Keras**.
